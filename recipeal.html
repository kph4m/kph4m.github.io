                Recipeal is a recipe manager that allows users to easily
                store and organize their favorite recipes, and help them

            <h1 class="section-header">Problem</h1>
            <p>
                Busy people and cooking novices need a way to find and
                organize recipes easily in order to save time looking and
                preparing for meals.

            <h1 class="section-header">Background</h1>
            <p>
                With how busy our lives have become due to work and family
                obligations, it can be difficult to make time to find the
                right recipes to make and organize them so they’re easily
                accessible. People need a centralized and convenient place
                to find new recipes and organize them so that they’re easily
                accessible. Although there are many recipe managers out
                there that could help with this, many of them have a
                confusing user interface and too many extra features, which
                can clutter the interface and make it hard to navigate. To
                address these problems, my team created Recipeal, a recipe
                manager that allows users to easily store and organize their
                favorite recipes, and help them explore new ones. We focused
                on making the design simple and easy-to-use so that users
                can solely focus on accomplishing their cooking tasks
                without the unnecessary clutter and confusing navigation.

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Understanding our competition</h2>
            <p>
                We examined many popular recipe managers and their features
                to identify what they do right and what they do wrong. We
                found that although many of our competitors had a large
                amount of features, this would often cause bloat and make it
                <b>more difficult to navigate</b>
                the application.

                in which they will use this type of product. The 2 personas
                we came up with are Tina, a working parent who needs help
                cooking for their family, and Johnny, a hobby chef who's
                interested in cooking/baking.

                After performing research to understand our competition and
                target audience, we defined the goal for our application:
                <b>To provide busy people an intuitive and hassle-free way
                    to organize their recipes to simplify the cooking
                    process.</b>

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Feature Prioritization</h2>
            <p>
                Given our 10 week timeline, we had to
                <b>prioritize some features over others</b>. We separated
                our potential features into 2 groups: core and extra. Core
                are the features that are essential to a recipe manager,
                such as recipe creation and organization. Extra are features
                that aren't necessary and only supplement the core features.
                We would be implementing these after the core features are
                completely implemented. We finalized the core features to be
                the CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) functions, and if
                we had time, we would work on extra features such as
                exploring new recipes, meal planners, and grocery lists.

                After solidifying the features we wanted and their priority,
                we laid out a roadmap detailing
                <b>what we would work on and an estimate of when they
                    should be completed</b>. It starts with developing the UI/UX, followed by
                developing the frontend and backend while simulataneously
                performing QA tests.

            <p>
                We created our low-fidelity based on our sketches. Since our
                goal was to simplify the user interfacer to make it as
                intuitive as possible, we decided on 3 main menus that we
                felt were essential for users:
                <b>My Recipes, Explore, and Favorites</b>.

                We polished the low-fidelity by creating better visuals and
                adding colors. At this point, we were indecisive in our
                original design so we started creating multiple different
                hi-fi's to brainstorm various designs.

            <p>
                I was responsible for this design. To brainstorm the
                styling, I first listed out adjectives that I wanted our
                recipe manager to convey and compiled images that expressed
                those adjectives. I settled on
                <b>various shades of green</b>
                for the colors, as I felt they conveyed adjectives such as
                <b>"fresh", "natural", and "healthy"</b>, which would make
                it more appealing for our users. From there, I created a
                style guide for the typography, user elements, and logos. I
                utilized the <b>card design</b> found in design 2 for most
                of the elements so users could easily identify the
                individual components.

            <p>
                Before we started developing our application, we needed to
                answer 3 key questions:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ol id="cs-ol">
                <li>
                    What technologies should we use? Should we use
                    frameworks?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What kind of web application did we want to create
                    (Single Page Application or Multiple Page Application)?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Should we utilize a database or local storage to store

                </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>Here's how we decided to address these questions:</p>
            <br />
            <ol id="cs-ol">
                <li>
                    We should strive to

                    <b>reduce the number of dependencies</b>. This means no
                    frameworks and minimal libraries. We will strictly be
                    using HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

                    Due to
                    <b>SPA's speed and mobile-friendly design</b>, we
                    thought this would be the best choice for delivering a
                    <b>good user experience</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Given the time constraints and the kind of data we'll be
                    working with, we will use
                    <b>local storage</b>
                    since it's
                    <b>sufficient for our needs</b>
                    and helps us
                    <b>avoid unnecessary complications</b>
                    that utilizing a database would cause.

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                We first created the base page, which is where HTML elements
                would be injected or hidden to display different pages. We
                next worked on the JavaScript functions that handle
                navigation of pages, CRUD functions, and recipe card
                creation. As mentioned, we used local storage to store and
                retrieve recipe data, which was relatively simple to do and
                saved us a lot of time. After we were done implementing the
                CRUD functions, we had some leftover time so we got to work
                on extra features like exploring new recipes, cook mode,
                timer, and text-to-speech. For fetching new recipes, we used
                the Spoonacular API.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />
                Upon implementing all of our features, we started working on
                the styling to make it look similar to our design mockup and
                making our app responsive to smaller screens. To do this, we
                utilized a few libraries to simplify the styling process,
                such as Bootstrap, SweetAlert, and Animate.css. During the
                whole development process, our QA testers implemented code
                quality checks and coverage using Codacy, Linter, and
                Cypress so that every time we pushed to main, tests would be
                run to ensure the quality of our code.

                    <b>Merge Conflicts:</b>
                    Since everyone was working out of a different branch,
                    when it came time to merge to main, many things would
                    break due to the differences in everyone's code.
                    Resolving these issues involved going through the code
                    line by line to make sure the new code wouldn't
                    interfere with the old ones. To reduce the number of
                    conflicts, we constantly communicated which features we
                    were working on and which parts of the code would be
                    modified.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Organization:</b>
                    Figuring out the best way to organize and refactor the
                    code was difficult. There were many files and functions
                    that were created by different people so it was hard to
                    figure out how to organize them so it's maintainable. To
                    solve these issues, we communicated and organized the
                    files in certain folders based on their functionality,
                    as well as put detailed comments in our code so we would
                    be aware of their relation with the code as a whole.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Time Constraints</b>: The short period of time we had
                    to work on the project caused us to rush our
                    development, skip certain bugs, and take shortcuts in
                    testing.
