            <p>Recipeal is a recipe manager that allows users to easily store and organize their favorite recipes, and

            <h1 class="section-header">Problem</h1>
            <p>Busy people and cooking novices need a way to find and organize recipes easily in order to save time
                looking and preparing for meals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-container">
            <h1 class="section-header">Background</h1>
            <p>With how busy our lives have become due to work and family obligations, it can be difficult to make time
                to find the right recipes to make and organize them so they’re easily accessible. People need a
                centralized and convenient place to find new recipes and organize them so that they’re easily
                accessible. Although there are
                many recipe managers out there that could help with this, many of them have a confusing user interface
                and too many extra features, which can clutter the interface and make it hard to navigate. To address
                these problems, my team created Recipeal, a recipe manager that allows users to easily store and
                organize their favorite recipes, and help them explore new ones. We focused on making the design simple
                and easy-to-use so that users can solely focus on accomplishing their cooking tasks without the
                unnecessary clutter and confusing navigation.</p>

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Understanding our competition</h2>
            <p>We examined many popular recipe managers and their features to identify what they do right and what they
                do wrong. We found that although many of our competitors had a large amount of features, this would
                often cause bloat and make it <b>more difficult to navigate the application.</b></p>

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Understanding our target audience</h2>
            <p>We created personas to help us <b>identify our audience's
                    needs, goals, and the context in which they will use this type of product</b>. The 2 personas we
                came up
                with
                are Tina, a working parent who needs help cooking for their family, and Johnny, a hobby chef who's
                interested in cooking/baking.</p>

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Defining the goal</h2>
            <p>After performing research to understand our competition and target audience, we defined the goal for our
                application: <b>To provide busy people an intuitive and hassle-free way to organize their recipes to
                    simplify the cooking process.</b></p>

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Feature Prioritization</h2>
            <p>Given our 10 week timeline, we had to <b>prioritize some features over others</b>. We separated our
                potential
                features into 2 groups: core and extra. Core are the features that are essential to a recipe manager,
                such as recipe creation and organization. Extra are features that aren't necessary and only supplement
                the core features. We would be implementing these after the core features are completely implemented. We
                finalized the core features to be the CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) functions, and if we had
                time, we would work on extra features such as exploring new recipes, meal planners, and grocery lists.

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Laying out the project roadmap</h2>
            <p>After solidifying the features we wanted and their priority, we laid out a roadmap detailing <b>what we
                    would work on and an estimate of when they should be completed</b>. It starts with developing
                the UI/UX,
                followed by developing the
                frontend and backend while simulataneously performing QA tests.</p>

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Sketches</h2>
            <p>We first created some rough sketches to give us a general idea of how the pages would be laid
                out. </p>

            <p>We created our low-fidelity based on our sketches. Since our goal was
                to
                simplify the user interfacer to make it as intuitive as possible, we decided on <b>3 main menus that we
                    felt were essential for users: My Recipes, Explore, and Favorites</b>.</p>

            <p>We polished the low-fidelity by creating better visuals and adding colors. At this point, we
                were
                indecisive in our original design so we started creating multiple different hi-fi's
                to brainstorm various designs.</p>

            <h2 class="section-subsubheader">Design 3</h2>
            <p>I was responsible for this design. To brainstorm the styling, I first listed out
                adjectives that I wanted our recipe manager to convey and compiled images that expressed those
                adjectives. I settled on <b>green as the primary colors and various other shades of green for secondary
                    colors</b>, as I felt they conveyed adjectives such as <b>"fresh", "natural", and "healthy",
                    which would make it more appealing for our users</b>. From there, I created a style guide for the
                typography, user elements, and logos. I
                utilized the <b>card design found in design 2 for most of the elements</b>, as I felt it would help
                users
                <b>easily identify the individual components</b>.

            <h2 class="section-subheader">Questions</h2>
            <p>Before we
                started developing our application,
                we
                needed to answer 3 key questions:</p>
            <br>
            <ol id="cs-ol">
                <li>What technologies should we use? Should we use frameworks?</li>
                <li>What kind of web application did we want to create (Single Page Application or Multiple Page
                    Application)?</li>
                <li>Should we utilize a database or local storage to store data?</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>Here's how we decided to
                address these questions:</p>
            <br>
            <ol id="cs-ol">
                <li>We should strive to <b>reduce the amount of technologies</b> we incorporate to <b>reduce the number
                        of dependencies</b>.
                    This means no frameworks and minimal libraries. We will strictly be using HTML/CSS and vanilla
                    JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Due to <b>SPA's speed and mobile-friendly design</b>, we thought this would be the best choice for
                    <b>delivering a
                        good user experience</b>.</li>
                <li>Given the time constraints and the kind of data we'll be working with, we will use <b>local
                        storage</b>
                    since it's <b>sufficient for our needs</b> and helps us <b>avoid unnecessary
                        complications</b>
                    that utilizing a database would cause.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h2 class="section-subheader">Implementation</h2>
            <p>We first created the base page, which is where HTML elements would be injected or hidden to display
                different pages. We next worked on the JavaScript functions that handle navigation of pages, CRUD
                functions, and recipe card creation. As mentioned, we used local storage to store and retrieve recipe
                data, which was relatively simple to do and saved us a lot of time. After we were done implementing the
                CRUD functions, we had some
                leftover time so we got to work on extra features like exploring new recipes, cook mode, timer, and
                text-to-speech. For fetching new recipes, we used the Spoonacular API.</p>
            <p>
                <br>
                Upon implementing all of our features, we started working on the styling to make it look similar to our
                design mockup and making our app responsive to smaller screens. To do this, we utilized a few libraries
                to simplify the styling process, such as Bootstrap, SweetAlert, and Animate.css. During the whole
                development
                process, our QA
                testers implemented code quality checks and coverage using Codacy, Linter, and Cypress so that every
                time we pushed to main, tests would be run to ensure the quality of our code.

            <ul id="cs-ul">
                <li><b>Merge Conflicts:</b> Since everyone was working out of a different branch, when
                    it came time to merge to main, many things would break due to the differences in everyone's code.
                    Resolving these issues involved going through the code line by line to make sure the new code
                    wouldn't interfere with the old ones. To reduce the number of conflicts, we constantly communicated
                    which features we were working on and which parts of the code would be modified.</li>
                <li><b>Organization:</b> Figuring out the best way to organize and refactor the code was difficult.
                    There were many files and functions that were created by different people so it was hard to figure
                    out how to organize them so it's maintainable. To solve these issues, we communicated and organized
                    the files in certain folders based on their functionality, as well as put detailed comments in our
                    code so we would be aware of their relation with the code as a whole.
                </li>

                <li><b>Time Constraints</b>: The short period of time we had to work on the projects caused us to rush
                    our development, skip certain bugs, and take shortcuts in testing. </li>
            </ul>

                <li>Filters for searched recipes so users can search for recipes that fit a certain criteria.</li>
                <li>Calendar implementation so users could plan out their recipes on certain days.</li>
                <li>Importing recipes given a website link so users could easily import recipes from the web to our
                    application.</li>
